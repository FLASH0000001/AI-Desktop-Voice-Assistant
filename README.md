# AI-Desktop-Voice-Assistant
I have created an AI Desktop Voice Assistant using only the Python Libraries/Modules. Firstly, I have imported text to speech converter module so we can give the program a voice to communicate with the user. And secondly, I have imported speech recognition module so if the user gives any voice command it will recognize it and done the given task.
